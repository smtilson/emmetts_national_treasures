# emmetts_national_treasures
"Emmett's National Treasures" project repository

While visiting my family for Christmas in 2024, I spent an evening at a friends. My old friend Emmett was there and began talking about his "National Treasures" list. This project is meant to enable such a list and allow for other interaction related to said lists. Such interactions could involve supplying supporting evidence, disagreements, or in fact statements of support.
A certain amount of joshing should be enabled, as long as nothing is taken too seriously.
