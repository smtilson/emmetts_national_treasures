# Progress

This document is for keeping track of progress and what is next. I guess I will use this instead of logseq, or maybe I can set up logseq to use this file? Would that mean that this file should be untracked?

## Branches

I want to document the point/goal of each branch here. This way, I can keep track of progress and what I plan to do next. It will also make documentation easier.

### Main

Things will be merged into this branch after tests pass.

### Backend

#### API Branch

I need to work on creating endpoints for each resource. I should create rough views, serializers, and models. Hook up the views to the relevant urls. Not sure what else should go in this branch. I think this branch should stick around and I can merge with main and then break off again to develop more of the API when I want.

### Frontend
